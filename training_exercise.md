# hybrid-SWM training and familiarization
Overview: This file has some redundancy with the associated WaterProgramming blog post [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2024/03/11/nonstationary-stochastic-watershed-modeling/). It is intended to
describe elements of the hybrid-SWM implementation in more detail than surface-level implementation in the README file. 
### Overview of the GRRIEN repository structure
In the Steinschneider group, we cover elements of the GRRIEN repository setup as part of internal training [here](https://github.com/SteinschneiderLab/lab-manual/tree/main/training/open_research). See also Rohini's
blog post on the same [here](https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2023/03/06/introducing-the-grrien-analysis-framework-defining-standards-for-reproducible-and-robust-supervised-learning-of-earth-surface-processes-at-large-spatial-scales/).
